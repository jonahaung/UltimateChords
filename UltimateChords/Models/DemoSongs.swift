She's a fool and don't I know it, But a fool can have her charms.
D6              C#m7             Bm7            F6b5  Fdim7 Ddim
I'm in love and don't I show it, Like a babe in arms.
D6                  Amaj7          D6              Amaj7   Gdim
Love's the same old sad sensation, Lately I've not slept a wink,
D6                   C#m7        Bm7           F6b5  Fdim7 Ddim
Since this half-pint imitation's Put me on the blink.

Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I

I couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
     A             C#7       Dmaj7        B+9
Then love came and told me I shouldn't sleep

She's got smile that it seems to me

reminds me of childhood memories,

she takes me away to that special place,

She's got eyes of the bluest skies,

I hate to look into those eyes

Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place

And pray for the thunder and the rain

to quietly pass me by
